# Project Title

Make Me Laugh

I like to laugh therefore I made a web-site with sounds of laughter.

# Installation
No installation needed.


# Code Review

1. `script.js:31 ` - Const div could be named card-item for easier understanding.
1. `script.js:60 ` - The body could be retrieved by calling document.body.
1. `script.js:67–90 ` - It’s similar code that could be run as a function that takes two parameters for the top and left offsets. 
1. `script.js:95 ` - The mobile or desktop function could be run in a resize event as well.
1. `.gitignore` - Should have an ignore for .DS_Store.
